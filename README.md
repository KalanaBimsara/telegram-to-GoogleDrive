```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/telegram-drive-bot.git
cd telegram-drive-bot
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies

MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Setup Google Drive API
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Create a new project.
3. Enable the **Google Drive API** for the project.
4. Create a **Service Account** and download the JSON credentials file.
5. Share the **Google Drive folder** where files will be uploaded with the service account email (`xxx@developer.gserviceaccount.com`).

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Bot
```sh
python main.py
```

## üõ† Usage Instructions
### **Step 1: Start the Bot**
Send `/start` to the bot. If it's your first time, it will ask for your **Google Drive JSON credentials file**.

### **Step 2: Upload Google Drive Credentials**
To obtain your **Service Account JSON file**, follow these steps:
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Select your project and navigate to **IAM & Admin > Service Accounts**.
3. Click **Create Service Account**, fill in the required details, and create it.
4. Once created, go to the **Keys** section and generate a new JSON key.
5. Download the JSON key file and keep it secure.

Next, you need to grant access to your Google Drive folder:
1. Go to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/).
2. Right-click the folder where you want to upload files and select **Share**.
3. Enter the **service account email** (found in the JSON file) and grant it **Editor** access.

Finally, upload the JSON file to the bot.

### **Step 3: Set a Google Drive Folder**
Use the following command to set the folder where files will be uploaded:
```sh
/setfolder FOLDER_ID
```
Replace `FOLDER_ID` with the actual **Google Drive Folder ID**.

### **Step 4: Upload Files**
Simply send a document, image, or video to the bot. It will:
- Download the file from Telegram.
- Upload it to your specified Google Drive folder.
- Return a link to the uploaded file.

## üéØ Deployment Options
### Deploy on a VPS (Linux)
```sh
nohup python main.py &
```
This will run the bot in the background.

### Deploy Using Docker
1. Build the Docker image:
   ```sh
   docker build -t telegram-drive-bot .
   ```
2. Run the container:
   ```sh
   docker run -d --env-file .env telegram-drive-bot
   ```

## üö® Troubleshooting
- **Bot doesn't respond?** Check if the **Telegram bot token** is correct.
- **File upload fails?** Ensure the **service account has access** to the Google Drive folder.
- **MongoDB connection error?** Verify the **MongoDB URI** in the `.env` file.
